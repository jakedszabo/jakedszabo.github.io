    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Precise communication is my passion. Since childhood, I have channeled the topics I was excited to learn about into writing, from media to science. While I began studying English at the University of California, Irvine to further my writing and research skills, my college career began with the sciences. I studied Molecular Biology at CU Boulder for two years. Even though I loved learning about the inner workings of bacteriophage genomics, conducting polymerase chain reaction experiments, and studying epidemiology, I realized my greater interest was in conveying them to an everyday audience. I strive to communicate technical information to help people like me understand and engage with complex topics. I have extensive copyediting skills, having worked as a copy editor and content writer during my academic career. I have used my research in the workplace to formulate business credit agreements, profiles on ecological researchers and their publications, LLC executive summaries, and market research reports. I have created technical manuals to share my knowledge and experience of software and instruments with others. I have created documentation troubleshooting for VSTs and used Python to extract X/Twitter analytics. I am also taking an engineering writing class to master the technical writing workflow. In this class, I have developed my skills as a project manager, improving my ability to communicate within a team to meet deadlines and solve conflicts. Currently, I am working on projects in GitHub, HTML, and XML, such as this website. </p>
