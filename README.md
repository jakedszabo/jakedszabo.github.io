    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Writing is something that I am deeply passionate about. Throughout my life, I have channeled the things which I was excited to learn about into writing, from climate change to physics. Althought I am currently studying English at the University of California Irvine with the hopes of furthering my craft through a writing career, my college career didn't start out that way. I began at CU Boulder studying Molecular Biology for two years. Though I loved learning about the innerworkings of phage genomics, doing PCR in the lab, etc. I realized my greater interest was in writing about all those things! Scientific communication and effective communication of technical information drive what I do in my academic career and the opportunities I have to use those skills in my career. I have extensive copyediting skills, having worked as a tutor, copyeditor, and content writer during my acadmeic career. I have used my own research to aid in formulating business credit agreements and LLC executive summaries. I use SEO concepts to adapt my own writing to the competitive world of content writing as well. I am developing technical writing skills through creating my own technical manuals to share my knowledge and experience with products to others. Currently, I am working on some projects in github and in HTML, XML to see how I can expand my technical skills.</p>
