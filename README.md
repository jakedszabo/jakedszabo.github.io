    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I am passionate about concise technical communication. Throughout my life, I have channeled the topics I was excited to learn about into writing, from media to science. Currently, I am studying English at the University of California Irvine to further my writing and research skills, but my college career didn't begin that way. I studied Molecular Biology at CU Boulder for two years. Even though I loved learning about the inner workings of bacteriophage genomics, conducting polymerase chain reaction experiments, and studying epidemiology, I realized my greater interest was in conveying them to everyday audiences. I strive for effective and engaging technical communication in my writing so that others can understand complex topics. I have extensive copyediting skills, having worked as a tutor, copy editor, and content writer during my academic career. I have used my research in the workplace to formulate business credit agreements, LLC executive summaries, profiles on ecological researchers, and market research reports. I am creating technical manuals to share my knowledge and experience with products to others and am taking engineering writing to get a concept of the technical writing workflow. In this class, I have developed my skills as a project manager, improving my ability to communicate within a team to meet deadlines and solve conflicts. Currently, I am working on some projects in github, HTML, and XML (like this website :)) and creating long-form content on biotechnical misinformation and epidemiology.</p>
