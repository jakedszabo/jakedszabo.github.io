    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Communication is my passion. Since childhood, I have channeled the topics I was excited to learn about into writing, from media to science. While I began studying English at the University of California, Irvine to further my writing and research skills, my college career began with the sciences. I studied Molecular Biology at CU Boulder for two years. Even though I loved learning about the inner workings of bacteriophage genomics, conducting polymerase chain reaction experiments, and studying epidemiology, I realized my greater interest was in conveying science information to an everyday audience. I have extensive copy writing experience, having written content for the WUICAN climate grant during my academic career, with my work being featured by the UC Office of the President. I have used my research skills in the workplace to formulate business credit agreements, profiles on ecological researchers and their publications, LLC executive summaries, and market research reports. I have created technical manuals to share my knowledge and experience of software and instruments with others. I have created documentation for troubleshooting Virtual Studio Technology (VSTs) and used Python to extract X/Twitter analytics. I became the first non-engineering student at UCI to take the Senior Engineering writing class where I successfully led a team to create a technical proposal for a smart kitchen product. Currently, I am working on further projects in GitHub, HTML, and XML, such as this website. </p>
